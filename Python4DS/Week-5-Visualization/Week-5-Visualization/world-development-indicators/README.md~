# World Development Indicators

This week, we will be using an open dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It is [The World Development Indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators) dataset obtained from the World Bank containing over a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world. 

This is a slightly modified version of the original dataset from [The World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators). 

List of the [available indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/d/worldbank/world-development-indicators/indicators-in-data) and a [list of the available countries](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/d/worldbank/world-development-indicators/countries-in-the-wdi-data).
